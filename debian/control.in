Description: LDAP-based CUPS configuration for Debathena
 This package configures CUPS to use LDAP-based printer discovery with
 printers.mit.edu.
 .
 As the printers.mit.edu server is still under testing, this package
 is not recommended for use in a production environment. It also is
 not guaranteed to work from an off-campus IP address.
